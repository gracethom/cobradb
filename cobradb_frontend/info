This is the folder for the CoBRA SQL Database front-end, data-entry interface.

index.php —- contains the input forms and is the central interface document

config.php —- contains configuration settings for the CoBRA SQL database

allprocess.php —- contains all input scripts to grab the value inputted in the interface form and insert that value into the database fields to create records. These are split based on activity type…

process1.php, process2.php, etc —- currently, the letter and review processes are live in these documents

form_buttons.js —- contains the separate forms which pop up when the data-entry user needs to create a new person or source

getautoname.php and getautosource.php —- documents for the autocomplete person and source fields - contain the code to look up and display possible matches as the user types in the fields. TODO: connect the selected values to their record in the CoBRA database

ind_forms folder contains separate interface forms for each activity type. These have been incorporated in the index.php file, so shouldn’t be necessary, but keeping for now.
